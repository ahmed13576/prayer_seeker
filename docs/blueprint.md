#Prayer Seeker

## Features I wish to add:

- Azan Time Input: Input field for the most recent azan time and drop-down box for type of namaz ie fajr, duhur, asr, maghrib, isha and name of the place.
- Prayer Time Inference: Infers the next prayer times based on the given azan time, type of namaz, location, and school of thought using an AI model.
- School of Thought Suggestion: Uses an AI model as a tool to determine the correct Islamic school of thought (Shia or Sunni) and whether it's Hanafi, Hanbali, Shafi, or Malik that best matches the provided azan time and suggests it to the user.
- Council Identification: Identifies the council that the initial azan time aligns with, using an AI model as a tool.
- Prayer Time Display and Adjustment: Displays the inferred prayer times and allows users to provide additional azan time samples to fine-tune the predictions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Teal (#008080) to represent spirituality and calmness.
- Secondary color: Sandy Beige (#F5F5DC) for a clean and neutral background.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700) to highlight important information such as prayer times.
- Clean and intuitive layout for easy navigation.
- Use clear and recognizable icons for prayer times and settings.
